# simple

Just a simple list=>details piece of code (not an app). 
Take a glance, made just to show my way of thinking about 
something simple where the app architecture comes into focus. 

Not finished, it can go different ways from here... e.g. adding redux
for encapsulating state update logic into smaller units etc.

Android, CLEAN, SOLID, MVI, Kotlin, Coroutines/Flow, Hilt,
OfflineFirst (proxy pattern), Room (caching, decorator pattern)...
